A itsla maintenance application.

# What this app do?

the app itself is a report based application. This application is able to report incidents that occur and save these reports for other technicians to work on.

## Simple introduction

This application is useful for people who want to report incidents that occur in the field such as damage, personnel shortages, accidents that occur, and others. this app was made by 3 people.

This application is still in the development stage, there are still a lot of bugs and the existing design is also made sober. so dont expect to much for this young kids make a big app that the quality is the same level as company's app. we're just field practice in this company, the app itself i think from scale 1 to 10 it's around 6 or 5.5 . i do judge my own code:) .
